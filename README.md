## Getting Started (Development)

This project was bootstrapped in Firebase Studio.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Spotify API Client ID and Client Secret:
    ```env
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:9002 # Or your deployment URL for Spotify redirects
    ```
    *Note: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is crucial for Spotify's OAuth redirect URIs. Make sure it matches the URL you're running the app on during development (e.g., `http://localhost:9002`) and the one configured in your Spotify Developer Dashboard for the backend API redirect (`${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/spotify/exchange-code`).*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, typically on port 9002.

5.  **(Optional) Run Genkit development server (for AI flows):**
    If you are working with or testing Genkit AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or for watching changes:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or the port specified in your `dev` script) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
